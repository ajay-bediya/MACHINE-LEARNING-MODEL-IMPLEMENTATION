Machine Learning Model Implementation in Python
📌 Overview
This project provides a complete implementation of a machine learning model using Python. It covers the end-to-end pipeline including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The goal is to build a reliable and reproducible ML workflow using popular Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

This repository can serve as a starter template for building classification or regression models and can be easily adapted to various datasets and business problems.

⚙️ Features
Load and clean structured datasets (CSV format)

Feature scaling and encoding

Train/test splitting

Model training with scikit-learn (default: RandomForest)

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Prediction on new/unseen data

Visualization of results (confusion matrix, ROC curve)

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Pipeline
You can run the entire pipeline step-by-step:

Preprocess the data

bash
Copy code
python src/preprocess.py --input data/raw.csv --output data/processed.csv
Train the model

bash
Copy code
python src/train.py --data data/processed.csv --model models/model.pkl
Evaluate the model

bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate.py --model models/model.pkl --data data/processed.csv
Make predictions

bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py --model models/model.pkl --input data/new_input.csv --output predictions.csv
📊 Evaluation Metrics
The default evaluation includes:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve (for classification tasks)

Metrics can be adjusted based on task type and business needs.

🛠 Customization
Modify train.py to change the machine learning model (e.g., switch to XGBoost or SVM).

Adjust preprocess.py for dataset-specific cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding.

Add hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for improved performance.

📎 Example Dataset
This project assumes you have a dataset in CSV format with labeled columns. A sample dataset is available in the data/ directory for testing purposes.
